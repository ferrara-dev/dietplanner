# Diet planner
***
#### Author: Samuel Ferrara
#### Project Group XX

## Project Description
***
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A webb application where users can tailor a diet plan after their own personal taste, goals and approximated energy expenditure. 


* The project architecture follows the Model-View-Presenter architecture pattern.
  

* [edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-nutrition-api) has been used for ingredient data and images

 
* Redux and react context has been utilized for state management.


* Firebase has been used for data persistance and user authentication.

The [React-Redux-Firebase API](https://react-redux-firebase.com/) has been used to create bindings between
redux and firebase.
### The Application

#### Registration
The user will be able to register an account 
by submitting account details (email and password) and personal information that the application uses to
approximate their total daily energy expenditure. The personal information which is needed includes 
current physical activity, height, weight, age and gender. 
Screenshots from the signup process are presented below.

#### User profile
The user can update their personal information at any given time, 
every update will be stored so that the users progress can be tracked.
As of now users can track their weight under the progress tab in the profile.

#### The diet plan
The diet plan that is created by the user consist of meal categories that are given a name and a priority at creation, 
where the priority indicates in what order to consume the meals.
(e.g. Breakfast with priority 1, Midday snack with priority 2, Lunch with priority 3 etc).

When a category is created, meals can be composed and added by searching and adding ingredients to the  
category.
